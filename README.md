# Neuroscience

# phase1:
I simulated LIF, ELIF and adaptive-ELIF nueron models with different kinds of input including arbitrary, fixed and random input, then drew cell's activity during time using different values of parameters. These graphs are included in a report file.

# phase2:
# phase3:
1. I Implemented STDP rule, then measured synaptic weight differences of each pre_synaptic and post_synaptic neurons, included these values in a graph for comparison included in report file, first page.

2. Two neural layers, first layer containing 10 neurons and second layer containing 2 neurons, are simulated. There are synapses between all the first layer neurons and the second layer neurons. At regular intervals, neurons of the first layer spike with two predetermined patterns, and a series of random spikes are performed between these two patterns. The aim is to study the learning of two output layer neurons and the changes in synapic weights using stdp. There are some graphs and outputs in the report showing synaptic weights' defferences and learning patterns of the two output neurons.

# phase4:
1. simulation of the incentive learning law. Then used neural network of the last phase, gave each output neuron a different layer and control their synaptic weights using rewards and punishments (using dopamin concentration). A graph indicating initial weights and final weights of these two neurons is included.
